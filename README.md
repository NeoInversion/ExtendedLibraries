Collection of C++ functions I find useful

## About
Currently, this is just a single header with a handful of functions. I'll likely add new functions some time in the future or as they pop up, or change how the functions are defined (one header and one source file, for example). If you have a function you think is generally useful, feel free to make a pull request.
